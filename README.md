# Python-Projects
Hi there,

My name is Joseph and I've been learning Python and JavaScript (as well as HTML and CSS) for the past couple of months now.
In this folder, you will find some of the Python projects that I have completed using '12 Python Projects' from freecodecamp on Youtube.
I have been aiming to do 1 project every Saturday. Will keep this updated to demonstrate and document my progress
